# WP33 Payment Boundary Confirmation

| Boundary | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| price constants unchanged | PASS | `tests/conversion-paywall-ux-polish.test.js` asserts `[REMOVED_FEATURE_PRICE]`, `9,900₮`, `[REMOVED_FEATURE_ANCHOR]`, `[REMOVED_FEATURE_UPGRADE]`, `STANDARD_WEIGHT_PRICE_MNT = 29000`, `COACH_WEIGHT_PRICE_MNT = 9900`, and `WEIGHT_TEST_AMOUNT_MNT = 9900`; `git diff -- app.js` shows copy-only paywall edits and no price constant edits. |
| QPay endpoint unchanged | PASS | `tests/conversion-paywall-ux-polish.test.js` asserts `/.netlify/functions/qpay-create-invoice` and `/.netlify/functions/qpay-check-payment`; `git diff -- mockBackend.js package.json _redirects` is empty. |
| product code unchanged | PASS | `tests/conversion-paywall-ux-polish.test.js` asserts `WEIGHT_TEST_PRODUCT_CODE = "WEIGHT_TEST_ONE_TIME"`. |
| entitlement logic unchanged | PASS | `tests/conversion-paywall-ux-polish.test.js` asserts the exact `hasRemovedFeatureAccess()`, `hasOneTimeReportAccess()`, and `hasUpgradeAccess()` return expressions. |
| paid depth gated | PASS | Unpaid render assertions confirm paid-only depth such as `Тэр мөчид хоол ямар мэдрэмж өгч байна вэ` and `Давтагддаг тойрог` are absent; paid render assertions confirm paid depth appears after access. |
| safety guidance ungated | PASS | Unpaid, paid, payment failed, professional, and urgent render assertions require `Аюулгүй байдлын сануулга` to remain visible. |
| payment failed does not hide safety | PASS | Payment failed render assertions require safe retry wording, the free first signal, and safety guidance to remain visible. |
| professional/urgent safety only | PASS | Professional and urgent render assertions require safety content and reject ordinary paid depth, ordinary experiment, and paid CTA. |
| no fake urgency | PASS | Conversion test rejects fake scarcity, limited seats, last-chance, fear-pressure, shame-pressure, `заавал`, `амжилтгүй`, and `сахилгагүй` wording. |
| no internal leak | PASS | Conversion test rejects `internalDiagnostics`, `ownerDebug`, `fixtureName`, `runtimeGate`, `decisionStatus`, and `rendererMode` in rendered output. |
